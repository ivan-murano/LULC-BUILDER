# LUMAP: semi-automatic Land Use MAPping for HWLEM Model
## Introduction
LUMAP is intended to provide land use/land cover creators with a set of QGIS tools to facilitate their tasks. It is meant for the preparation of land use and land cover to perform simulations with the heatwave and pluvial flood models by [PLINIVS](http://plinivs.it/home/).

## Data preparation
### Database
In order to use LUMAP's processing, it is necessary to get all the data needed for land use mapping.
A comprehensive list of datasets with European and global coverage [is available at this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x3dQlRSy_SqumFkzOOL34jFV_FpbkwlAoGrK3ELR8Ak/edit?usp=sharing), which can provide an excellent starting point.
The database is constantly being updated and expanded, and any suggestions and feedback are welcome.
