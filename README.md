# LUMAP: semi-automatic Land Use MAPping for HWLEM Model
## Introduction
LUMAP is intended to provide land use/land cover creators with a set of tools to facilitate their tasks. It is meant for the preparation of landuse and landcover to perform simulations with the heatwave and pluvial flood models by PLINIVS.

## Data preparation
### Database
In order to use LUMAP's processing, it is necessary to get all the data needed for land use mapping.
A comprehensive list of datasets with European and global coverage [is available at this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x3dQlRSy_SqumFkzOOL34jFV_FpbkwlAoGrK3ELR8Ak/edit?usp=sharing), which can provide an excellent starting point.
The database is constantly being updated and expanded, and any suggestions and feedback are welcome.
